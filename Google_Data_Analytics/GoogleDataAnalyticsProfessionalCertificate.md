# WEEK 1: LEARNING LOG: THINK ABOUT DATA IN DAILY LIFE

## Everyday data 

Before you write an entry in your learning log, think about where and how you use data to make decisions. You will create a list of at least five questions that you might use data to answer. Here are a few examples to inspire you:

* What’s the best time to go to the gym?

* How does the length of your commute to work vary by day of the week?

* How many cups of coffee do you drink each day?

* What flavor of ice cream do customers buy?

* How many hours of sleep do you get each day? 

Then, you will select one of the five questions from your list to explore further and write down the types of data you might collect in order to make a decision. That’s data analysis in action!

## Phases of Analytical process

* Ask
* Prepare
* Process
* Analyze
* Share
* Act

## Data analytics in everyday life

* **Data analysis** is the collection, transformation, and organization of data to draw conclusions, make 
  predictions, and drive informed decision making.

* **Data analytics** can help organizations completely rethink something they do or point them in a 
  totally new direction.

# Case Study: New data perspectives

People analytics is the practice of collecting and analyzing data on the people who make up a company’s workforce in order to gain insights to improve how the company operates.

Being a people analyst involves using data analysis to gain insights about employees and how they experience their work lives. The insights are used to define and create a more productive and empowering workplace. This can unlock employee potential, motivate people to perform at their best, and ensure a fair and inclusive company culture. 

## Use case: People analytics

An organization was experiencing a high turnover rate among new hires. Many employees left the company before the end of their first year on the job. The analysts used the data analysis process to answer the following question: **how can the organization improve the retention rate for new employees?**
Here is a break down of what this team did, step by step. 

**ASK**

First up, the analysts needed to define what the project would look like and what would qualify as a successful result. So, to determine these things, they **asked** effective questions and collaborated with leaders and managers who were interested in the outcome of their people analysis. These were the kinds of questions they asked:

* What do you think new employees need to learn to be successful in their first year on the job? 

* Have you gathered data from new employees before? If so, may we have access to the historical data?

* Do you believe managers with higher retention rates offer new employees something extra or unique?

* What do you suspect is a leading cause of dissatisfaction among new employees?

* By what percentage would you like employee retention to increase in the next fiscal year?

**PREPARE** --> **preparation**

It all started with solid **preparation**. The group built a timeline of three months and decided how they wanted to relay their progress to interested parties. Also during this step, the analysts identified what data they needed to achieve the successful result they identified in the previous step - in this case, the analysts chose to gather the data from an online survey of new employees. These were the things they did to prepare:

* They developed specific questions to ask about employee satisfaction with different business processes, 
  such as hiring and onboarding, and their overall compensation. 

* They established rules for who would have access to the data collected - in this case, anyone outside 
  the group wouldn't have access to the raw data, but could view summarized or aggregated data. For example, an individual's compensation wouldn't be available, but salary ranges for groups of individuals would be viewable. 

* They finalized what specific information would be gathered, and how best to present the data visually. 
  The analysts brainstormed possible project- and data-related issues and how to avoid them. 

**PROCESS** --> data **collected, stored, managed, and protected**

The group sent the survey out. Great analysts know how to respect both their data and the people who provide it. Since employees provided the data, it was important to make sure all employees gave their consent to participate. The data analysts also made sure employees understood how their data would be **collected, stored, managed, and protected**. Collecting and using data ethically is one of the responsibilities of data analysts. In order to maintain confidentiality and protect and store the data effectively, these were the steps they took:

* They restricted access to the data to a limited number of analysts. 

* They cleaned the data to make sure it was complete, correct, and relevant. Certain data was aggregated 
  and summarized without revealing individual responses. 

* They uploaded raw data to an internal data warehouse for an additional layer of security.

**ANALYZE** --> **discovered** and **document**

Then, the analysts did what they do best: analyze! From the completed surveys, the data analysts **discovered** that an employee’s experience with certain processes was a key indicator of overall job satisfaction. These were their findings:

Employees who experienced a long and complicated hiring process were most likely to leave the company. 

Employees who experienced an efficient and transparent evaluation and feedback process were most likely to remain with the company. 

The group knew it was important to **document** exactly what they found in the analysis, no matter what the results. To do otherwise would diminish trust in the survey process and reduce their ability to collect truthful data from employees in the future. 

**SHARE** --> **sharing the report**, **communicate the results**

Just as they made sure the data was carefully protected, the analysts were also careful **sharing the report**. This is how they shared their findings:

They shared the report with managers who met or exceeded the minimum number of direct reports with submitted responses to the survey. 

They presented the results to the managers to make sure they had the full picture. 

They asked the managers to personally deliver the results to their teams. 

This process gave managers an opportunity to **communicate the results** with the right context. As a result, they could have productive team conversations about next steps to improve employee engagement. 

**ACT** --> **implement changes and take actions**

The last stage of the process for the team of analysts was to work with leaders within their company and decide how best to **implement changes and take actions** based on the findings. These were their recommendations: 

Standardize the hiring and evaluation process for employees based on the most efficient and transparent practices. 

Conduct the same survey annually and compare results with those from the previous year. 

A year later, the same survey was distributed to employees. Analysts anticipated that a comparison between the two sets of results would indicate that the action plan worked. Turns out, the changes improved the retention rate for new employees and the actions taken by leaders were successful! 

# Business Analytics

Is "the use of math and statistics to derive meaning from data in order to make better business decisions."

There are four key types of business analytics: **descriptive**, **predictive**, **diagnostic**, and **prescriptive**. 

* **Descriptive analytics** is the interpretation of historical data to identify trends and patterns.
* **Predictive analytics** centers on taking that information and using it to forecast future outcomes. 
* **Diagnostic analytics** can be used to identify the root cause of a problem. 
* **Prescriptive analytics**, testing and other techniques are employed to determine which outcome will 
  yield the best result in a given scenario. They uses techinques like optimization or A-B testing to advise managers and workers on how bes to do their jobs.

Across industries, these data-driven approaches have been employed by professionals to make informed business decisions and attain organizational success.

One approach is the **DELTA** model:

* **(D)**ata:
- It's clean, accessible, and often unique to your company. 

* **(E)**nterprise-focus:
- An enterprise wide-focus, with key data systems and analytics resources to the whole firm, not just 
  isolated teams.

* **(L)**eaders:
- Leaders at all levels that promote a data-and-analytics driven culture.

* **(T)**argets:
- For key business areas that could benefit from this approach.

* **(A)**nalysts:
- Talented analysts, to execute the strategy.

## Business Analytics vs. Data Science

* The main goal of **business analytics** is to extract meaningful insights from data to guide 
  organizational decisions.

* **Data science** is focused on turning raw data into meaningful conclusions through using algorithms and 
  statistical models.

# Cassie: Dimensions of data analytics

A **Data Analyst** is an explorer, a detective and an artist all rolled into one.

Now, **data science**, the discipline of making data useful, is an umbrella term that encompasses three disciplines: **machine learning**, **statistics**, and **analytics**.

These are separated by how many decisions you know you want to make before you begin with them:
* If you want to make a few important decisions under uncertainty, that is **statistics**. 
* If you want to automate, in other words, make many, many, many decisions under uncertainty, that is 
  **machine learning** and **AI**.
* But what if you don't know how many decisions you want to make before you begin? What if what you're 
  looking for is inspiration? You want to encounter your unknown unknowns. You want to understand your world. That is **analytics**.

# What is the data ecosystem?

**Data ecosystems** are made up of various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data. These elements include hardware and software tools, and the people who use them.

Data can also be found in something called the **cloud**. The cloud **is a place to keep data online, rather than on a computer hard drive**. So instead of storing data somewhere inside your organization's network, **that data is accessed over the internet**. So **the cloud is just a term we use to describe the virtual location**. 

It's your job to harness the power of that data ecosystem, find the right information, and provide the team with analysis that helps them make smart decisions. 

## Difference between data scientists and data analysts

* **Data science** is defined as creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw 
  data. Data scientists create new questions using data.
* **Data Analysts** find answers to existing questions by creating insights from data sources. 

**Data analysis** is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.

**Data analytics** is the science of data.

# How data informs better decisions

## Data-driven decision-making

Using facts to guide business strategy.
The first step in data-driven decision-making is **figuring out the business need**. Usually, this is a problem that needs to be solved. 

For example, a problem could be a new company needing to establish better brand recognition, so it can compete with bigger, more well-known competitors. Or maybe an organization wants to improve a product and needs to figure out how to source parts from a more sustainable or ethically responsible supplier. 

A **data analyst** finds data, analyzes it and uses it to uncover trends, patterns and relationships. Sometimes the data-driven strategy will build on what's worked in the past. Other times, it can guide a business to branch out in a whole new direction.

Data alone will never be as powerful as data combined with human experience, observation, and sometimes even intuition. To get the most out of data-driven decision-making, it's important to include insights from people who are familiar with the business problem. These people are called **subject matter experts**, and they have the ability to look at the results of data analysis and identify any inconsistencies, make sense of gray areas, and eventually validate choices being made.

As a data analyst, you play a key role in empowering these organizations to make data-driven decisions.

# Key data analyst skills

Analytical skills are qualities and characteristics associated with solving problems using facts.
They are:
* Curiosity, 
* Understanding context: How you group things into categories. 
* Having technical mindset:  Breaking processes down into smaller steps and working with them in an 
                             orderly, logical way.
* Data design: How you organize information.
* Data strategy:  Managing the processes and tools used in data analysis.

# WEEK 2

# All about thinking analytically

## Analytical thinking

Identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in an organized, step-by-step manner.
The 5 key aspects of analytical thinking are:

1. **Visualization**:
   The graphical representation of information (graphs, maps, etc)

2. **Strategy**:
    Having a strategic mindset is key to staying focused and on track. Strategizing helps data analysts see what they want to achieve with the data and how they can get there.
    Strategy also helps improve the quality and usefulness of the data we collect. By strategizing, we know all our data is valuable and can help us accomplish our goals.

3. **Problem-orientation**:
   To identify, describe, and solve problems. It's all about keeping the problem top of mind throughout the entire project.

4. **Correlation**:
   A correlation is like a relationship. Correlation does not equal causation. In other words, just because two pieces of data are both trending in the same direction, that doesn't necessarily mean they are all related.

5. **Big-picture and detail-oriented thinking**:
   Being able to see the big picture as well as the details. It's all about figuring out all of the aspects that will help you execute a plan. In other words, the pieces that make up your puzzle. 

# Exploring core analytical skills


**The Five Whys**

Let's talk about some of the questions data analysts ask when they're on the hunt for a solution. Here's one that will come up a lot: What is the root cause of a problem? A root cause is the reason why a problem occurs. If we can identify and get rid of a root cause, we can prevent that problem from happening again. A simple way to wrap your head around root causes is with the process called the Five Whys. In the Five Whys you ask "why" five times to reveal the root cause. The fifth and final answer should give you some useful and sometimes surprising insights.

Example:
Let's say you wanted to make a blueberry pie but couldn't find any blueberries. You've been trying to solve a problem by asking, why can't I make a blueberry pie? The answer will be, there are no blueberries at the store. There's Why Number 1. You then ask, why were there no blueberries at the store? Then you discover that the blueberry bushes don't have enough fruit this season. That's Why Number 2. Next, you'd ask, why was there not enough fruit? This would lead to the fact that birds were eating all the berries. Why Number 3, asked and answered. Now we get to Why Number 4. Ask why a fourth time and the answer would be that, although the birds normally prefer mulberries and don't eat blueberries, the mulberry bush didn't produce fruit this season, so the birds are eating blueberries instead. Finally, we get to Why Number 5, which should reveal the root cause. A late frost damaged the mulberry bushes, so it didn't produce any fruit. You can't make a blueberry pie because of the late frost months ago. See how the Five Whys can reveal some very surprising root causes.

**Gap analysis**

Another question commonly asked by data analysts is, where are the gaps in our process? For this, many people will use something called gap analysis. Gap analysis lets you examine and evaluate how a process works currently in order to get where you want to be in the future. Businesses conduct gap analysis to do all kinds of things, such as improve a product or become more efficient. The general approach to gap analysis is understanding where you are now compared to where you want to be. Then you can identify the gaps that exist between the current and future state and determine how to bridge them.
